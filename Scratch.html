            <p>
                When i first started programing i was introduced to Scratch
                at around age 12. I wasn't very good to begin with but i
                carefully learned all the basics and moved to more advanced stuff.
                <br> <span></span>
                As a first language i would definitely recomend scratch, as it
                teaches the basics even better than python could.

            <p>
                As of today I'm no longer using Scratch and all simple projects 
                is now made using python, but i still recommend Scratch
                for beginners, who dont want to learn an entire language
                to start making games and programs.
