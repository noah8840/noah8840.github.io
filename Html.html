            <p>
                Right now I'm still in the progress of learning HTML.
                <br> <span></span>
                HTML is proving to be very easy and i dont expect to be
                using much more time on it before moving on to JavaScript,
                but its very nice to be familier with HTML, since it will
                definitely come in handy in the future.

                Currently there are no other HTML projects besides
                this one.
